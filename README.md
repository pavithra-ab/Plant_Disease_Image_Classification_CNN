# Plant_Disease_Image_Classification_CNN

### About Dataset
The PlantVillage Dataset is organized into three distinct folders: train, test, and validation. Each of these folders contains a total of 15 subfolders, corresponding to 15 unique classes of plant diseases. This meticulous categorization allows for efficient and precise classification of different types of diseased plant leaves.

In the dataset, the division of images follows a strategic split: 80% of the images are allocated to the train folder, 10% to the test folder, and the remaining 10% to the validation folder. This distribution ensures a robust evaluation of models by providing ample data for training, unbiased testing, and accurate validation. As a result, researchers and developers can leverage this well-structured dataset to create and fine-tune algorithms that effectively identify and address various plant diseases, contributing to improved agricultural practices and crop management.

### Tasks Performed:-
1. Load the test, train and validation datasets
2. Building the CNN model
3. Testing the accuracy of the model
4. Prediction using the model
